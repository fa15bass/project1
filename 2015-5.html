<p><strong><u>Problem #5: Four-Digit Number Cycler</u></strong><br>
<div>Background Information: 	An educational, software company, Maths-R-Us, is in need of a program that will show students the details of the traditional multiplication of positive integers algorithm. Specifically, they want a program that will show the multiplicand, the multiplier, each line obtained from the application of the distributive property, and the final product.  </div></p>
<div>For example, if the multiplicand is 39 and the multiplier is 846 then the following output including the multiplication operator x, the dashed lines, and the place value zeros are required.</div>
