<p><strong><u>Problem #3: Polygon Labeling</u></strong><br>
<div>Background Information:	There are (n-1)! ways to uniquely label the vertices of an n-gon. If  any labeling of an n-gon can be rotated to match a previous labeling, the labeling is not unique.  However, a labeling is unique, even if a reflection (or reflection followed by a rotation) of the labeling matches a previous labeling. For example, Figures 1 and 2 below are not uniquely labeled but Figures 1 and 3 are uniquely labeled. </div></p>

The Automated Testing Company needs a program that will input two lists of integers and determine if the second is (or is not)  a cycle of the first. If the second is a cycle of the first, then the two would not uniquely label an n-gon. Each list will contain between 3 and 20 positive integers. . Obviously, if different integers are used for the labeling, there is no cycle. The program will output the appropriate message of either CYCLE or NO CYCLE. 
<div>Programming Problem:</div>
<dl>
	<dt>Input:		A pos. integer 3 <= n <= 20 for the size of the n-gon followed by two labeling lists.<br>
Each list will consist of n positive integers. </dt>
	<dt>Output:	Either "CYCLE" or "NO CYCLE".</dt>


	<dt>Example1: </dt>	
	<dd>Input: 3 
				1					
				2				
				3			
				2	
				1	
				3
	</dd>
	<dt>Output:    NO CYCLE				</dt>			
	<dt>Example 2:</dt>	
	<dd>Input:	4 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 6						
			</dd>
		<dt>Output:  NO CYCLE</dt>
