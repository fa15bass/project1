<h1>Problem #2: Simplified Poker</h1>
<div>
<p>
Background Information:	Most poker hands use five cards. In simplified four card poker, four cards are used for a hand. Four card poker hands are classified as one of the following: a Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four-of-a-Kind, Flush, Straight, Three-of-a-kind, Two-pairs, One-Pair, Nothing.  You will be given four cards from a regulation 52-card deck of playing cards. Your program will determine if the four cards constitute:</p>
</div>
<div>
<b>Four-of-a-Kind</b>   (all four cards of the same kind),<br>
<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b>  (three cards of the same kind and one card different),<br>
<b>Two-Pairs </b>          (two cards of the same kind and the other two cards of the same kind 
                               but different than the first pair),<br>
<b>One-Pair </b>             (two cards of the same kind and the other two cards of different kinds),<br>
Or<br>
<b>No-Matches. </b>        (all four cards of different kinds),<br>
Note that in simplified poker we are not computing any other type of hand such as flushes or straights.<br></div>
<div>
<p>
Normally, each card would be designated with a kind and a suit. For this problem, we will be ignoring the suits and just designating the kind of each card. The kind will be in the range  [2, 14], with  2 for a Two, 3 for a Three, â€¦ 11 for a Jack, 12 for a Queen, 13 for a King, and 14 for an Ace.
Cards will be input from lowest to highest.

Programming Problem:
	Input:		Four integers (in the range 2..14) in ascending order.
The four integers will be on four separate lines. 
	Output:	The type of hand followed by the four cards (integers).

	Example 1:	Input:	7 7 7 7
		Output:	Four-of-a-Kind   7 7 7 7
	
	Example 2:	Input:	3 9 9 9
		Output:	Three-of-a-Kind   3 9 9 9

Example 3:	Input:	2 4 4 6
	Output:	One-Pair    2 4 4 6

Example 4:	Input:	10 11 12 13
Output:	No-Matches      10 11 12 13
